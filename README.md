## About The Project
This project has been started to understand basic functions and get familiar with Xilinx PYNQ,<br/> 
To achieve this goal<br/> 

1. Build a PYNQ Linux image for a custom board (Dabin System's RRAR Digital Board) <br/> 
   which uses Zynq MPSoC ZU5CG as the main FPGA<br/><br/> 
   Image build environments<br/> 
   Unbuntu 20.04 installed on Virtual Box<br/> 
   Xilinx Vitis, Petalinux, Vivado tool version : 2022.1<br/> 
   PYNQ version : 3.01<br/><br/>  
2. Initialize custom board peripherals (e.g. clock and transceiver etc)<br/><br/>  
3. Capture A/D data and plot the data in the time/frequency domain<br/><br/> 
<br/>
